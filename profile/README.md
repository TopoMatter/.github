# Hi there 👋

This is the github page of the "[Topological states of matter](https://www.ifw-dresden.de/ifw-institutes/itf/home/research-topics-teams/topological-states-of-matter)" group at the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden ([IFW Dresden](https://www.ifw-dresden.de/) for short).

We're theoretical physicists who study the properties of topological systems and explore new types of topological phases. These include topological insulators and superconductors, but also gapless systems such as Weyl semimetals. Part of our focus is on determining the stability of topological phases to perturbations such as disorder, as well as studying their dynamical properties.

## Group Members

Our team is currently made up of three PhD students:

Gabriele Naselli

Ihor Nimyi

Raghav Chaturvedi

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
