## Hi there 👋

This is the github page of the "[Topological states of matter](https://www.ifw-dresden.de/ifw-institutes/itf/home/research-topics-teams/topological-states-of-matter)" group at the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research Dresden ([IFW Dresden](https://www.ifw-dresden.de/) for short).

We're theoretical physicists who study the properties of topological systems and explore new types of topological phases. These include topological insulators and superconductors, but also gapless systems such as Weyl semimetals. Part of our focus is on determining the stability of topological phases to perturbations such as disorder, as well as studying their dynamical properties.
